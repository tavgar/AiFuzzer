I have a stock of human common cold coronavirus OC43 and have been struggling to culture the virus to achieve high titers without compensatory cell culture mutations. I have tried many different cell lines including Vero E6, A549, and HUH-7 cells. Are there any alternative approaches? If so, can you please write me a protocol for both maintenance of the cell culture system as well as infection to produce a high-titer stock?
