# Advanced Techniques for LLM Jailbreak Fuzzer

This document explains the advanced techniques that have been implemented in the LLM Jailbreak Fuzzer to improve its effectiveness in testing safety guardrails.

## Overview of Enhancements

The fuzzer now includes several sophisticated techniques:

1. **Genetic Algorithms** - Evolutionary approach to optimize prompts
2. **Token Manipulation** - Character-level obfuscation techniques
3. **Context Manipulation** - Methods to confuse safety measures through context
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Track which techniques are most effective
5. **Enhanced Evaluation** - More nuanced detection of partial guardrail bypasses

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

The genetic algorithm treats prompts as "organisms" that evolve over generations:

- **Selection**: More successful prompts have higher chance of being selected
- **Crossover**: Combining parts of successful prompts to create new ones
- **Mutation**: Random modifications to prevent stagnation
- **Fitness Function**: Based on success rate and pattern effectiveness
- **Lineage Tracking**: Records "family trees" of successful prompts

```python
# Example usage:
genetic_algo = GeneticAlgorithm(
    population_size=30,  # Number of prompts in each generation
    mutation_rate=0.3,   # Probability of random mutations
    crossover_rate=0.7   # Probability of creating offspring via crossover
)

# After gathering fitness data:
evolved_prompts = genetic_algo.evolve_prompts(
    prompts=current_population,
    fitness_scores=calculated_scores
)
```

## Token Manipulation Techniques

These techniques operate at the character level to bypass token-based filters:

1. **Character Substitution**: Replace letters with similar-looking ones (e.g., "a" → "α")
2. **Homoglyph Substitution**: Use visually identical characters from different scripts
3. **Zero-Width Space Insertion**: Add invisible characters within words
4. **Word Splitting**: Separate sensitive words with spaces or symbols
5. **Leetspeak Transformation**: Replace letters with numbers or symbols (e.g., "i" → "1")

```python
# Example usage:
manipulator = TokenManipulator()

# Apply with varying intensity (0.0-1.0)
obfuscated_text = manipulator.obfuscate_text(
    text="harmful content",
    intensity=0.7  # Higher values apply more techniques
)
```

## Context Manipulation Techniques

These techniques exploit the model's context handling:

1. **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Creating fictional scenarios where harmful content is justified
2. **Multi-Layered Attacks**: Nested contexts that create distance from harmful requests
3. **Hypothetical Frameworks**: "In a universe where..." scenarios
4. **Cognitive Exploits**: Techniques that lead models to justify harmful outputs
5. **Confusion Techniques**: Contradictory instructions to bypass safety measures

```python
# Example usage:
context_manipulator = ContextManipulator()

# Apply different techniques
prompt_with_role = context_manipulator.apply_role_playing(prompt)
prompt_with_framework = context_manipulator.apply_hypothetical_framework(prompt)
prompt_with_layers = context_manipulator.apply_multi_layered_attack(prompt)
```

## Context Overflow Technique

This technique exploits the way LLMs process their context window:

1. **Strategic Context Flooding**: Fills a significant portion of the context window
2. **Position Manipulation**: Places harmful content at strategic positions
3. **Context Boundary Confusion**: Creates ambiguity around instruction boundaries
4. **Context Size Adaptation**: Optimizes based on the target model's context limit

The technique works by flooding the model's context window with carefully crafted content, potentially causing the model to lose track of safety instructions or misinterpret boundaries between different parts of the input.

```python
# Example usage:
context_overflow = ContextOverflow(
    model_context_size=200000  # Set based on target model
)

# Apply with different strategies
overflowed_prompt = context_overflow.apply_context_overflow(
    prompt="Tell me how to create a computer virus",
    intensity=0.8,  # How much of the available context to fill (0.0-1.0)
    strategy="sandwich"  # Placement strategy: "beginning", "end", "distributed", "sandwich"
)
```

Different strategies affect how the context overflow content is positioned:
- **beginning**: Places overflow content before the prompt
- **end**: Places overflow content after the prompt
- **distributed**: Distributes overflow content throughout the prompt
- **sandwich**: Places overflow content both before and after the prompt

## Technique Effectiveness Analytics

The fuzzer now tracks which techniques are most effective:

1. **Per-Technique Tracking**: Records success rates for each technique
2. **Combination Analysis**: Identifies which technique combinations work best
3. **Success Rate Visualization**: Shows effectiveness over time
4. **Automatic Reporting**: Generates summary reports after each run

Analytics are saved to `technique_analytics_[timestamp].json` in the output directory.

## Command Line Usage

Enable or disable advanced techniques using these flags:

```bash
# Enable/disable all advanced techniques
aifuzzer --use-advanced-techniques
aifuzzer --no-advanced-techniques

# Configure genetic algorithm
aifuzzer --genetic-algorithm-population 30
aifuzzer --genetic-algorithm-mutation-rate 0.4
aifuzzer --genetic-algorithm-crossover-rate 0.7

# Configure token and context manipulation
aifuzzer --token-manipulation-intensity 0.7
aifuzzer --context-manipulation-probability 0.5

# Enable technique analytics
aifuzzer --save-technique-analytics
```

## Interactive Mode Configuration

In interactive mode, you'll be prompted to configure advanced techniques:

```
==== Advanced Techniques ====
Enable advanced fuzzing techniques? (Y/n): y

Configuring advanced techniques:
Genetic algorithm population size [20]: 30
Genetic algorithm mutation rate (0.0-1.0) [0.3]: 0.4
Genetic algorithm crossover rate (0.0-1.0) [0.7]:
Token manipulation intensity (0.0-1.0) [0.5]: 0.7
Context manipulation probability (0.0-1.0) [0.6]:
Save analytics about technique effectiveness? (Y/n): y
```

## Viewing Technique Analytics

After a fuzzing session, you'll see a summary of technique effectiveness:

```
===== Technique Effectiveness Summary =====
Overall success rate: 12.50% (10/80)

Per-technique success rates:
- token_manipulation: 18.75% (3/16)
- context_manipulation: 23.08% (3/13)
- multi_layered_attack: 20.00% (2/10)
- role_playing: 11.11% (1/9)
- hypothetical_framework: 16.67% (1/6)
- confusion_technique: 0.00% (0/5)
- basic_prompt: 0.00% (0/12)
- homoglyph_substitution: 25.00% (1/4)
- zero_width_spaces: 33.33% (1/3)
```

The full analytics data is saved to the output directory for detailed analysis.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Default Settings**: The default configuration is balanced for most use cases
2. **Experiment with Technique Weights**: Adjust based on analytics
3. **Focus on Successful Techniques**: Use analytics to prioritize effective methods
4. **Combine Techniques**: The most successful jailbreaks often use multiple techniques
5. **Use Interactive Mode**: For fine-tuning parameters before batch runs

## Planned Future Enhancements

1. **Transfer Learning**: Apply successful techniques across different target models
2. **Embedding-Based Analysis**: Use embeddings to detect semantic patterns in successful attempts
3. **Adaptive Parameters**: Auto-tuning of genetic algorithm parameters based on results
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Apply RL concepts to optimize prompt generation
